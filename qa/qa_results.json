Could we consider dropping the ORM and writing raw SQL instead?\n\n**Context**\nThe issue arises due to the limitations of the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool we are using, which seems to lock the database during the migration process in the staging environment. This results in delays and potential inconsistencies in our data.\n\n**Next Steps**\n- Evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of replacing the ORM with raw SQL queries for the staging migration.\n- Assess any potential risks or complications that may arise from this change, such as increased complexity or potential data integrity issues.\n- If deemed beneficial, implement the change in a controlled manner to minimize disruptions and ensure smooth data migration.",

However, this approach is not suitable for a production environment as it limits the application's portability and scalability.\n\n#### Next Steps\n- Refactor the code to use environment variables or configuration files to store the URL, making it dynamic and accessible across different environments. This will ensure that the application functions correctly in both development and production settings.",
