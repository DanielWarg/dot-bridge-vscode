I am writing to discuss the recent request for the inclusion of five new features in the current sprint that is already at capacity.\n\nWhile we understand the desire to implement these features as soon as possible, it is important to maintain a balanced workload within each sprint to ensure quality and timely delivery. Adding more features at this stage may compromise our ability to deliver the existing tasks on time or with the desired level of quality.\n\nWe propose that these new features be considered for implementation in the next sprint instead. This approach will allow us to maintain our current pace while still accommodating your requests, ensuring a smooth workflow and high-quality output.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]",
